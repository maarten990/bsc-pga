\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

\TODO{Process this outline:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Recap on what we made. GAViewer extension, incl. casting, incl. some visualizations.
  \item Need more work in g2 (parabolic, elliptic pencil of linear complexes), g3 (regulus), g4 (parabolic, elliptic linear congruence), g5 (direct) visualization.  
  \item This is an analysis of the Pl\"ucker model for $\reals^3$. Easily generated for $\reals^n$ with odd $n$.  How can this be applied for even $n$? Which geometric entities do live there?
  \item Corollary with g1, g3 objects and g1, g2, g3 of homogeneous model?
  \item How different are ideal objects from Euclidean objects?
  \item Need visualization for versors.
\end{enumerate}
