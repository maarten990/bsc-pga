This thesis describes a method for computationally recognizing the geometrical interpretation of the elements of the model of projective line geometry in geometric algebra.  These different interpretations are not merely recognizable by the grade of the elements, or the absense or presence of some basis vector, as can be done for conformal geometric algebra.

GAViewer, a graphical calculator for the Euclidean and conformal models of geometric algebra, is extended to implement the projective line geometry and this visualization.

\textbf{Keywords:} Geometric algebra, projective geometry, Pl\"ucker coordinates, homogeneous coordinates.
